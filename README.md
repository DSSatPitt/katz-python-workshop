# Introduction to Collecting Web Data with Python


This repository contains the materials for a Python workshop held at the University of Pittsburgh.

This two-day workshop will teach the basics of the Python programming language with a focus on collecting data from web sites and social media platforms. Day one will introduce Python and the Jupyter Notebook. On day two we will cover Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and web scraping. Participants will receive hands-on training and leave with introductory knowledge of Python.

Dates:
- **March 31st**: Introduction to Python, Jupyter, & basic command line
- **April 7th**: Introduction to APIs and Web Scraping with a little bit of Pandas

Location:
