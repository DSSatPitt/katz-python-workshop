    "This tutorial was originally drawn from [Scipy Lecture Notes](http://www.scipy-lectures.org/) by [this list of contributors](http://www.scipy-lectures.org/preface.html#authors). I've continued to modify it as I use it.\n",

    "  etc. Some specific features of Python are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* an *interpreted* (as opposed to *compiled*) language. Contrary to e.g. C or Fortran, one does not compile Python code before executing it. In addition, Python can be used **interactively**: many Python interpreters are available, from which commands and scripts can be executed.\n",
    "* a free software released under an **open-source** license: Python can be used and distributed free of charge, even for building commercial software.\n",
    "* **multi-platform**: Python is available for all major operating systems, Windows, Linux/Unix, MacOS X, most likely your mobile phone OS, etc.\n",
    "* a very readable language with clear non-verbose syntax* a language for which a large variety of high-quality packages are\n",
    "    available for various applications, from web frameworks to scientific\n",
    "    computing.\n",
    "* a language very easy to interface with other languages, in particular C and C++.\n",
    "* Some other features of the language are illustrated just below. For example, Python is an object-oriented language, with dynamic typing (the same variable can contain objects of different types during the course of a program).\n",

    "All this indentation business can be a bit confusing in the beginning. However, with the clear indentation, and in the absence of extra characters, the resulting code is very nice to read compared to other languages.\n",
    "* **Indentation depth**: Inside your text editor, you may choose to indent with any positive number of spaces (1, 2, 3, 4, ...). However, it is considered good practice to **indent with 4 spaces**. You may configure your editor to map the `Tab` key to a 4-space indentation. In Python(x,y), the editor is already configured this way.\n",
