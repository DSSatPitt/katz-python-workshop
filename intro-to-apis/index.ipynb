    "# Introduction to APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial introduces Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) using the Yelp API as an example. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "- API: An Application Programming Interface is the mechanism by which computers can talk to other computers and share information.\n",
    "- REST API: This is a type of API that uses standard web protocols to communicate.  \n",
    "- Endpoint: This is a URL, just like you see in a web browser, for requesting specific kinds of data from the API.\n",
    "- Request: A request is how you initiate a conversation with an API in order to \"request\" information. Requests are made to specific endpoints.\n",
    "- Parameters: When you issue a request to an *endpoint*, that is make a web request, you usually include some parameters, like search terms, to refine your query.\n",
    "- Response: When you make an API request\n",
    "- JSON: JavaScript Object Notation is the data format many APIs use to communicate over tehe web.\n",
    "- Credentials/Authentication/Keys: Many APIs require some form of authentication in order to get information. Because APIs are computers talking to computers it is not a good practice to use usernames and passwords (those are for humans!). Instead, APIs often use a system called [OAuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth) in which the API service gives you an access token or a key instead of a password. *Don't share your access tokens!* \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Because every API is different, it is important to become familiar with the various endpoints and parameters by *reading the documentation*. Looking at [Yelp's documentation](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/overview) the API seems to be divided into three main functions:\n",
    "- [Search API](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/search_api): For searching Yelp through text queries, geographic area, or categories.\n",
    "- [Business API](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/business): For getting information about specific businesses.\n",
    "- [Phone Search API](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/phone_search): For finding businesses by their phone number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive into the Python code, we should play with the [Yelp API Console](https://www.yelp.com/developers/api_console). \n",
    "\n",
    "Note, we are going to cheat a little bit because we are going to use a 3rd party library, [yelp-python](https://github.com/Yelp/yelp-python) to do most of the heavy lifting.\n",
    "\n"
